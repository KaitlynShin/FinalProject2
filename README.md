Conclusion-
I found out that my data set concluded by finding that the west end was the perfect neighborhood for a zombie apocalypse. The population was the lowest in all of my data findings. And In this case, it is the best place to hide and avoid zombies. I did not find the results of my group members' neighborhood selection.
