## Description

**Our final project is about finding the best place to move in case of a zombie apocalypse using 3 datasets from the WPRDC website.** 

We decided to do the metric .... Our datasets are parks, bridges, and population. Basic Explaination

Conclusion-
I found out that my data set concluded by finding that the west end was the perfect neighborhood for a zombie apocalypse. The population was the lowest in all of my data findings. And In this case, it is the best place to hide and avoid zombies. I did not find the results of my group members' neighborhood selection.

## Conclusion

Based on the data collected from the WPRDC, it was determined that the Bridges and Parks in the City of Pittsburgh datasets were most useful in concluding the best neighborhood in case of a Zombie Apocalypse.  For the Bridges in the City of Pittsburgh dataset, there were two neighborhoods with an extremely high number of bridge connections.  Squirrel Hill South had a total of 14 bridge connections and Central Business District had a total of 12.  However, the remaining neighborhoods did not exceed a total of 7 bridge connections so the dataset was truncated to only represent the neighborhoods with the highest number of bridge connections.  With that information, the Parks in the City of Pittsburgh dataset was explored and it was discovered that East Liberty had a total of 12 parks and Central Business District had a total of 10.  The remaining neighborhoods did not exceed a total of 8 parks, and therefore the dataset was truncated as well for better comparisons.  Combining the information from both datasets, it was clear that the best neighborhood would be Central Business district as it had the highest combination of bridge connections and number of parks.

**Kaitlyn:** From the combined data collected from WPRDC, it was determined that Central Business District is the best neighborhood in the case of a Zombie Apocalypse.  With having both the second most amount of bridge connections and the number of parks, Central Business District would be the most secure and have the most places to hide.  This differs from my personal favorite neighborhood of Squirrel Hill South which ended up having the most amount of bridge connections, along with a total of 6 parks.  Ultimately, Squirrel Hill South would also be a good choice in the case of a zombie apocalypse, however, it wouldnâ€™t be the best.

**Maia**: Our result for the best neighborhood was the Central Business District. Having not been from Pittsburgh, I did not know what to expect for the best neighborhood. WIth my dataset, the Central Business District was the second highest with having the most parks. I do wish my dataset had a bit more data to compare and contribute to the best neighborhood in case of a zombie apocalypse.
